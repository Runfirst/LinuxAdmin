#If you maintain multiple Redhat Linux Servers in your local network and want to save Internet bandwidth or speed up the downloading of the same remote repository packages over and over again, or are within a very restrictive network environment where access to any remote Redhat repository is blocked for your clients, you might want to consider running your own YUM repository. Having your own repository is also an excellent solution if you want to roll our a few custom or unofficial RPM packages (For example in-house configuration files or programs) to your local crowd or if your just want to create an official Rehat repository mirror site.
