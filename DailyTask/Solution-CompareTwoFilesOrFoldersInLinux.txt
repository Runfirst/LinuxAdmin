#How to find the difference between two directories in Linux

#Solution 1: diff 
#Here, we want to know what files/subdirectories are common in the two directories, those are present in one directory but not in the other.
$diff [option]... FILES 
$diff options dir1 dir2

#By default, its output is ordered alphabetically by files/subdirectory names. In this command, the "-q" switch tells diff to report only when files differ.
$diff -q directory-1/ directory-2/
Only in directory-2/: Firefox-for.png
Only in directory-2/: Firefox-in.pnf
Only in directory-2/: Flats-theme.png 
only in directory-1/: Flat-Messager.png 
#Diff doesn't go into the subdirectories, but we can use the "-r" switch to read the subdirectories as well like this 
$diff -qr directory-1/ directoy-2/

#Solution 2: rsync --dry-run option allow you to run a trial run of rsync without actually transferring any files.
$rsync --dry-run [options] source_directory destination_directory 

#For example, to compare the contents of the /home/user/source directory to the /home/user/destination directory
$rsync --dry-run /home/user/source /home/user/destination
