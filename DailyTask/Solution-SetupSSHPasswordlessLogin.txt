#SSH (Secure SHELL) is also used to transfer files from one computer to another computer over the network using SCP or RSYNC
#How to set up password-less login on RHEL-based Linux distributions, and Debian-based distributions using ssh keys to connect to remote Linux servers without entering password.

#Setup Environment
    SSH Client : 192.168.0.12 ( Fedora 36 )
    SSH Remote Host : 192.168.0.11 ( CentOS 8 )

#Step 1. Create Authentication SSH-Keygen Keys on (192.168.0.12)
#First login into server 192.168.0.12 with user tecmint and generate a pair of public keys using the following command.
$ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/tecmint/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter key]
Created directory '/home/tecmint/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter key]
Enter same passphrase again: [Press enter key]
Your identification has been saved in /home/tecmint/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/tecmint/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
...

$Step2. Upload SSH Key to - 192.168.0.11
#Use SSH from server 192.168.0.12 and upload a newly generated public key (id_rsa.pub) on server 192.168.0.11 under user name sheena's .ssh directory as a file name authorized_keys.
$ssh-copy-id sheena@192.168.0.11

#Make sure that the correct permissions are set on the ~/.ssh directory and the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server.
$ssh sheena@192.168.0.11 "chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"


#Step 3. Disable Password Authentication (Optional)
#For increased security, you can disable password authentication on the remote server and only all SSH key authentication. 
#To do this, open the SSH server configuration file on the remote server:
$vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
...
PasswordAuthentication no 
...
$systemctl restart sshd 


#Step 4. Test SSH Passwordless login from 192.168.0.12
$ssh sheena@192.168.0.11
