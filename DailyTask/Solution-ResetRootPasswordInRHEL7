#For you to be able to reset the root password on CentOS 7/RHEL 7, you need a working GRUB boot loader.
  >Step 1: reboot the server
  
  >Step 2: press "e" in the GRUB2 boot screen to edit the GRUB2 command line.

  >Step 3: find the line that loads the kernel - this line generally begins with "linux16" or "linuxefi"

  >Step 4: Remove the parameters "rhgb" and "quiet" from this line and, at the end of the line, add the string "rd.break enforcing=0"

  >Step 5: Press "Ctrl+X" and the system will boot with the edited parameters. If the root filessystem is encrypted, a password prompt will appear if you press the backspace key. You can then enter the password to enable temporary, read-only mounting of the root filesystem. It will be mounted as "/sysroot/"

  >Step 6: You must remount the root filesystem in read-write mode before you can make any changes to configuration details such as passwords. This is done with the following command:
  $mount -o remount,rw /sysroot

  >Step 7: You shoud now set your environment to the filesystem mounted on /sysroot, so that all commands pertain to that filesystem and its files:
  $chroot /sysroot/ 

  >Step 8: Now, issue the "passwd" command and follow instructions to change the root password:
  $passwd

  >Step 9: Still within the chroot environment, remount your root filesystems as read-only. Then exit the chroot environment:
  $mount -o remount,ro /
  $exit
