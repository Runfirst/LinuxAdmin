#Config rsyslog to become a log server
    >Step 1. rsyslog works on the 514 port configuration of tcp or udp protocol.
        [root@test ~]$grep -i "tcp" /etc/rsyslog.conf 
        #Provides TCP syslog reception
        $ModLoad imtcp
        $InputTCPServerRun 514
        #Remote Logging (we use TCP for reliable delivery)

        [root@test ~]$grep -i "udp" /etc/rsyslog.conf 
        #Provides UDP syslog reception 
        $Modload imudp
        $UDPServerRun 514
    
    >Step2. Restart the rsyslog service, configure rsyslog on its client computer, and let its logs be sent to the rsyslog server for records.
        [root@test ~]$systemctl restart rsyslog 
        [root@test ~]$ss -ntul

    #Explanation: after restarting the service, port 514 has been up, then configure the rsyslog of the client to send logs to the log server through the network
        [root@test ~]$grep "192.168.0.99" /etc/rsyslog.conf 
        *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none            @192.168.0.99

    #Explanation: The above configuration means that except for mail, authpriv, and cron, the info and logs above info level of all facilities are sent to 192.168.0.99 for records.
    #A "@" indicates that the connection server is through UDP protocol connection, logs are transmitted through UDP protocol; 
    #Two "@" indicate that the connection server is connected through "TCP", and logs are transmitted through TCP protocol.

    >Step3. Restart the rsyslog service on the client, and view the client's log on the server
        [root@test ~]$/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart 
        Shutting down system logger:        [  OK  ]
        Starting system logger:             [  OK  ]
        [root@test ~]$logger "I am test-node1."
        [root@test ~]$tail /var/log/messages

#Rsyslog records logs in myriadb
    >Step1. Prepare the database server 
        [root@test ~]$yum install mariadb
